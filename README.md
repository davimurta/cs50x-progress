# CS50x – Learning Progress

This repository documents my learning journey through Harvard's CS50x course.
The goal is to build strong computer science fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills,
and deeply understand how software works under the hood.

## What you'll find here

- Weekly problem sets and exercises
- Notes written in my own words
- Reflections on challenges and solutions
- A final project applying core CS concepts

## Main topics covered

- Algorithms and problem solving
- Memory and pointers
- Data structures
- Computational thinking
- Programming in C, Python, and SQL

## Purpose

This repository is not about copying solutions, but about documenting learning,
decision-making, and technical growth over time.

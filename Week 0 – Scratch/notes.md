# CS50x – Week 0 (Introduction)

## What Computer Science really is

Computer Science is not about learning programming languages.
Languages are just tools.

The core of Computer Science is **problem solving**:

- understanding a problem
- breaking it into smaller parts
- defining clear steps to solve it

This means that learning how to think is more important than memorizing syntax.

## Key idea: Problem Solving

A computer will only do exactly what you tell it to do.
If the instructions are unclear or incomplete, the result will be wrong.

So the real challenge is not coding,
but expressing solutions in a precise and logical way.

## MIT Fire Hydrant Story

One of the examples shown was the famous MIT fire hydrant hack,
where students connected a fire hydrant to a drinking fountain.

 This illustrates:

- creativity in problem solving
- using existing systems in unexpected ways
- thinking beyond the "intended use" of a tool

## Personal interpretation – Learning perspective

I also interpreted this example from a learning perspective.

It shows that having a large **supply of information** is not enough
if the system (or the person) cannot absorb it at the same pace.

In the context of studying:

- consuming too much content at once leads to shallow understanding
- learning requires time to process and reflect
- progress depends on absorption, not volume

This reinforces the importance of studying at a sustainable pace,
focusing on depth rather than speed.

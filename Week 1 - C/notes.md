# CS50x – Week 1 (C)

## Source Code and the Development Environment

Source code is the human-readable version of a program.
It is written by developers using programming languages
and describes the logic and behavior of a system.

However, computers cannot execute source code directly.
It must first be transformed into a form the machine understands.

In CS50, Visual Studio Code is used as the development environment.
It provides tools to:

- write source code
- run programs
- interact with the compiler
- view output and errors

The editor itself does not execute the program.
It acts as an interface between the developer and the system.

## From Input to Output – The compilation process

Programs often follow a simple but powerful flow:
input → processing → output.

In languages like C, source code is passed to a compiler,
which translates it into machine code.

The compilation step is essential because:

- humans write code in high-level languages
- computers execute low-level instructions

Once compiled, the program can receive input,
process it according to its logic,
and produce output.

This reinforces the idea that software is a transformation
of input data into meaningful output through defined rules.

## GUI vs CLI – Different ways to interact with programs

Programs can be interacted with in different ways.

A GUI (Graphical User Interface) allows users to interact
using visual elements such as:

- buttons
- windows
- icons

A CLI (Command Line Interface) allows interaction
through text-based commands.

While GUIs are more intuitive for most users,
CLIs offer greater control, transparency, and efficiency,
especially for development and debugging.

In CS50, the CLI is emphasized because it:

- exposes how programs actually run
- makes input and output explicit
- helps understand what the computer is doing step by step

## Hello, World

"Hello, World" is usually the first program written in a new language.

Its goal is not to be complex, but to show the full flow:

- writing source code
- compiling it
- executing the program
- seeing output on the screen

Even a very small program already follows all these steps.

## Input and Output

In this example, the program does not receive input.
It only produces output.

The `printf` function sends text to standard output (the terminal).

This reinforces the idea that programs are based on:

- input
- processing
- output
